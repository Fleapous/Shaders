Welcome to the Shaders repository, a space where I explore and develop shader concepts for future projects.

## Installation

To try any of these assets, you can download individual project folder from this repository. Unfortunately, I haven't packaged this project as a Unity package yet :(

## Projects

### Procedural Toon Terrain

In this project, I utilize vertex/fragment shaders to displace vertices on a given mesh, creating a procedural infinite terrain.\

#### Installation and Usage

Unity version 2022.3.6f1. Render Pipeline built-in.\
For downloading the project, clone or download the [Procedural_Toon_Terrain](https://github.com/Fleapous/Shaders/tree/main/Procedural_Toon_Terrain) file (I will create a package in the future ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).\
In the Unity project, assign the shader to a plane object (either the default one or a procedurally generated one).

A detailed explanation of settings will be provided after I finnish the project :).
